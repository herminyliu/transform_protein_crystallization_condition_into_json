Crystals were pulverized, pooled together in the reservoir solution, vortexed with a Seed-Bead (Hampton Research) for 45 s, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at minus 80 degrees C. For seeding crystallization trials, the frozen seed was thawed and diluted 500-fold in 25% (v/v) PEG 300, 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.5).
Preparation of diffraction quality (delta)ABD-p110(delta):idelalisib crystals started with a mixture of 0.48 microliters of 2.5% (w/v) n-dodecyl-(beta)-D-maltoside, 0.30 microliters of 20 mM ligand, and 12 microliters of 12 mg/ml (delta)ABD-p110(delta) in storage buffer (described above). The mixture was allowed to sit for 1 h at room temperature instead of 4 degrees C to prevent the formation of white precipitate. Seeded vapor diffusion droplets were assembled by adding 90 nl of the 500-fold diluted seed (described above) to 100 nl of the n-dodecyl-(beta)-D-maltoside-ligand-(delta)ABD-p110(delta) mixture.

Crystals were pulverized, pooled together in the reservoir solution, vortexed with a Seed-Bead (Hampton Research) for 45s, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 degrees C. For seeding crystallization trials, the frozen seed was thawed and diluted 500-fold in 25% (v/v) PEG 300, 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.5).
Preparation of diffraction quality (delta)ABD-p110(delta):GS-9901 crystals started with a mixture of 0.48 microL of 2.5% (w/v) n-dodecyl-(beta)-D-maltoside, 0.30 microL of 20 mM ligand, and 12 microL of 12 mg/ml (delta)ABD-p110(delta) in storage buffer (described above). The mixture was allowed to sit for 1 h at room temperature instead of 4 degrees C to prevent the formation of white precipitate.
